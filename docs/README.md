## Build Locally

Use a separate documentation environment. From the repository root:

```bash
uv venv .venv-docs --python 3.12
uv pip install --python .venv-docs/bin/python -r docs/requirements.txt
.venv-docs/bin/sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
```

Live preview:

```bash
PATH="$PWD/.venv-docs/bin:$PATH" make -C docs serve PORT=8080
```

Notebook execution is disabled in the normal documentation build. Install system Pandoc only when building notebook content that requires it.

## Contributing

Prefer Markdown and relative links. Register new site pages in [index.rst](./index.rst). README pairs use `README.md` (English) and `README_zh.md` (Chinese), with reciprocal links. Keep commands, defaults, and numerical results identical between languages. Run the relevant regression tests and documentation checks before submitting changes.
