# MOSS-VL Realtime WebSocket API v2

**English** | [简体中文](./API_zh.md)

This document defines the complete external interface provided by this repository's `vl_api_adapter`. The model is MOSS-VL Realtime and the protocol identifier is `vl-api-v2`. See the [README](./README.md) for deployment and client examples and the [validation record](../../../deployment/vl_api_v2/VALIDATION.md) for test results.

**Normative terms:** **MUST** indicates a requirement; **MUST NOT** a prohibition; **SHOULD** a recommendation requiring justification when departing from it; **MAY** an option. Other text is explanatory.

## 1. Transport and Connection

WebSocket text messages carry control events (UTF-8 JSON, one object per message). Binary messages carry image data.

One connection represents one session. No separate session-creation request is required. Connections rejected for authentication or capacity do not establish a model session; see section 7.

The backend path is `/v1/video/realtime`. v2 runs on a separate listener; the repository launcher defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:18610/v1/video/realtime`. Native v1 defaults to port 18500. Both share the model and session capacity. The URL path alone does not identify the protocol.

Every control event MUST contain `type`. Client events use strict validation (`extra="forbid"`): unknown fields reject the entire event. Values must have the correct types; NaN/Infinity are rejected, and strings cannot substitute for integers or booleans. The server may add output fields; clients should ignore unknown output fields.

When `VL_API_V2_API_KEY` is configured, the handshake MUST include `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Otherwise there is no application-level authentication; use a trusted network or an authenticated gateway. Public TLS/WSS termination is a deployment responsibility. `GET /health` provides runtime status, not a session event or accounting API.

This interface does not provide REST session creation, `task_id` allocation, reset, or cross-connection memory merging. Those belong to the caller.

## 2. Session State Machine

```text
Connection admitted
  -> session.created
  <- session.configure
  -> session.configured
  -> session.ready
  <-> Frames / prompts, acknowledgements, text and silence
  -> response.done (one response settled; session continues)
  <-> Further input and responses
  -> session.done (session terminal)
  -> WebSocket Close
```

Do not send frames or prompts until `session.ready`. Text and telemetry may interleave with input acknowledgements. Clients MUST keep receiving all events, not wait exclusively for a particular ACK. Each input's accepted event precedes its processed event.

**Response completion is not session completion.** Model-origin silence after visible text closes that response and produces one `response.done`. Repeated silence without new visible text does not create empty responses or duplicate settlements. A period without network messages is not a response boundary.

An orderly termination with successful final accounting ends with exactly one `session.done`. No text, usage or ACK events follow it. Exceptions for unavailable final accounting and transport failure are defined in section 7.2.

## 3. Client Events

### 3.1 `session.configure`

Send exactly once after connection, within `session.created.configure_timeout_s`.

```json
{
  "type":"session.configure",
  "prompt":"Observe the video and answer my questions.",
  "max_new_tokens":128,
  "max_tokens_per_turn":10,
  "include_usage":true
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Default / Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | Yes | `session.configure` |
| `prompt` | string | No | `""`; initial user prompt, not the system prompt |
| `system_prompt` | string/null | No | `null`; omitted, null or empty string uses the backend default system prompt. A nonempty string supplies a separate system prompt |
| `max_new_tokens` | int | No | 4096; positive generation allowance, defined below |
| `max_tokens_per_turn` | number | No | 86400; positive generation rate limit in tokens/s, not a token total or guaranteed minimum speed |
| `temperature` | number | No | 0; range [0, 2] |
| `top_p` | number | No | 1; range (0, 1] |
| `input_queue_capacity` | int | No | 4; range [1, 256], defined in section 6 |
| `include_usage` | bool | No | false; controls only optional `session.usage` telemetry |
| `benchmark_ignore_eos` | bool | No | false; true is rejected unless the server explicitly permits benchmark mode |

`include_usage` does not affect `response.done.usage` or `session.done.usage`. Settlement usage is intrinsic to the protocol, regardless of telemetry preference.

**Generation allowance:** after initial input processing, the model has `max_new_tokens` available. Each extend that processes new frames or prompts re-anchors the remaining allowance to that value, subject to context capacity. With 128 configured, generating 30 tokens and then processing another frame permits up to 128 further tokens from that position, not 98 or 226. Generated silence and other control tokens count toward the allowance, not just visible text.

This is neither a fixed per-response cap nor a session-wide output cap. Continued input can allow one response or the entire session to exceed that number. `response.done` does not replenish it; model processing of new input does. The model may choose silence first; exhausting the allowance or satisfying model stop conditions can end the request.

### 3.2 `input.frame`

Send metadata, wait for `input.frame.ready`, then send the binary image.

```json
{"type":"input.frame","seq_no":0,"timestamp":0.0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg"}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | Yes | `input.frame` |
| `seq_no` | int | Yes | Non-negative integer; see section 3.4 |
| `timestamp` | number | Yes | Video time in seconds; finite, non-negative and not earlier than the previous accepted frame |
| `mime_type` | string | Yes | `image/jpeg`, `image/png` or `image/webp`; must match the encoding |
| `prompt` | string/null | No | Default null; a new question accompanying the frame. Whitespace-only text is treated as no question |
| `final` | bool | No | Default false; true identifies the last input |

Fields outside this table, including `size_bytes`, are rejected.

After ready, the client MUST send that frame's binary message next; it MUST NOT send the binary before ready. Send the complete image file bytes directly, not JSON, base64 or multipart.

Only one frame handshake may be awaiting binary on a connection. Clients should wait for accepted before sending the next input. Another frame's metadata or a prompt during an unfinished handshake is rejected. Binary delivery is due within 10 seconds after ready by default. Empty, oversized, corrupt or MIME-mismatched images are rejected; see section 7.3.

### 3.3 `input.prompt`

```json
{"type":"input.prompt","seq_no":1,"prompt":"What is in the image?","final":false}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | Yes | `input.prompt` |
| `seq_no` | int | Yes | See section 3.4 |
| `prompt` | string | Yes | Nonempty, non-whitespace question; the field is `prompt`, not `text` |
| `final` | bool | No | Default false; true identifies the last input |

A prompt inherits the most recent frame timestamp; it does not accept a separate `timestamp`. A non-final question may trigger speech or model silence while awaiting more frames. Immediate visible output is not guaranteed.

After `final=true` is accepted, no further input is allowed. The model completes remaining inference under its existing generation/stop conditions and ends the session; final does not close the connection at the first silence. Wait for `session.done` or explicitly abort.

### 3.4 Sequence Numbers

Frames and prompts share one contiguous `seq_no` sequence starting at zero. Accepted input MUST NOT reuse a sequence number or skip numbers.

Only explicitly rejected, unaccepted input may retry the same sequence number after correction. Rejection does not advance the expected number. A sequence gap is rejected without closing the session. If a disconnect leaves acceptance unknown, do not assume replay is idempotent; establish a new session.

### 3.5 `session.abort`

```json
{"type":"session.abort"}
```

Requests termination. It consumes no sequence number, accepts no additional fields, and does not wait for frame handshakes or input credit. When final accounting succeeds, the server responds with `session.done`, reason `aborted`. An existing fatal cause is preserved rather than overwritten with aborted. Stopping and final accounting have bounded waits, not a zero-latency guarantee; see section 7.2.

## 4. Server Events

### 4.1 `session.created`

```json
{
  "type":"session.created",
  "session_id":"video_sess_...",
  "request_id":"video_req_...",
  "model":"moss-vl-realtime",
  "turn_id":0,
  "configure_timeout_s":180.0,
  "protocol_version":"vl-api-v2",
  "model_version":null,
  "model_version_source":"unknown",
  "capabilities":["session.usage","response.done.usage","session.done.usage","error.seq_no","input.frame.rejected","response.done.per_response","response.id","usage.text_input_output"]
}
```

`session_id` and `request_id` are opaque backend identifiers, not gateway task/trace IDs. This interface does not return `task_id`.

`model_version` is the deployment label supplied through `VL_API_V2_MODEL_VERSION`. Its source is `deployment` when configured; otherwise the values are null/`unknown`. It is neither the protocol version nor an automatically computed weight checksum.

Clients MUST check capabilities. Per-response accounting requires `response.done.per_response` and `response.id`; `session.usage` or the model name alone is insufficient. The configure deadline starts at backend session creation and ends when valid configuration is accepted; model prefill is not part of that deadline.

### 4.2 `session.configured`

```json
{"type":"session.configured","session_id":"video_sess_...","request_id":"video_req_...","max_frame_bytes":33554432,"input_queue_capacity":4,"max_tokens_per_turn":10.0,"parked_request_timeout_s":3600.0,"context_limit":131072}
```

Returns effective input credit, generation rate, frame byte limit, parked timeout and actual backend context capacity. This example uses repository deployment settings, not universal constants.

### 4.3 `session.ready`

```json
{"type":"session.ready","session_id":"video_sess_...","request_id":"video_req_...","turn_id":0}
```

The model session is ready to receive input.

### 4.4 Input Acknowledgements and Rejection

| Event | Meaning | Fields besides type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input.frame.ready` | Awaiting this frame's binary; backpressure signal | `seq_no` |
| `input.frame.accepted` | Image passed reception validation and was submitted to the backend | `seq_no`, `timestamp`, `final`, `pending_events`, `interrupts_current_turn` |
| `input.prompt.accepted` | Prompt submitted to the backend | `seq_no`, `final`, `pending_events`, `interrupts_current_turn` |
| `input.frame.processed` | Model processed the frame input, not just received its bytes | `seq_no`, `timestamp`, `final`, `pending_events`; may include `turn_id`, `interrupted_turn_id` |
| `input.prompt.processed` | Model processed the prompt | Same processed fields |
| `input.frame.rejected` | This frame handshake was rejected | `seq_no`, `reason` |

`pending_events` counts outstanding inputs when the acknowledgement is sent, not global sessions. Accepted does not guarantee model processing or a completed answer. `interrupts_current_turn` indicates a new question; processed/interrupted events establish the actual turn transition.

Recoverable frame rejection sends both error and input.frame.rejected. The client MUST stop waiting for that attempt's ready/processed event. A missing or unusable sequence number cannot be invented; rejected may contain `seq_no: null`. A fatal session termination ends all remaining input waits.

### 4.5 `response.text.delta`

```json
{"type":"response.text.delta","delta":"The image shows","turn_id":1,"response_id":"response_...","response_seq":1}
```

Append delta text in receive order. The first non-whitespace visible text creates the response ID. Earlier whitespace-only deltas may have null response_id/response_seq and MUST NOT establish a settled response.

### 4.6 `response.turn.silence`

```json
{"type":"response.turn.silence","turn_id":1,"seq_no":0,"timestamp":0.0,"silence_seq":1}
```

The model enters silence. `seq_no`/`timestamp` can be null when no input is associated yet. `silence_seq` is the backend silence sequence, not the response sequence.

An active visible response is closed by silence, followed by its response.done. Silence without new visible text does not produce response.done; its usage carries into the next settlement or final residual.

### 4.7 `response.turn.interrupted`

```json
{"type":"response.turn.interrupted","turn_id":1,"next_turn_id":2,"seq_no":1,"response_id":"response_..."}
```

A new question advances the turn and interrupts the old turn. response_id identifies the interrupted active segment, or is null if none exists. Interrupted segments do not receive a normal response.done. Repeatedly interrupted sessions may have no response.done at all; final session usage is the fallback.

### 4.8 `response.done`

Completes one response, not the session.

```json
{
  "type":"response.done",
  "response_id":"response_...",
  "response_seq":1,
  "turn_id":1,
  "finish_reason":"stop",
  "boundary":"silence",
  "usage":{
    "vision_tokens":145,"text_input_tokens":78,"text_output_tokens":10,
    "text_tokens":88,"total_tokens":233,
    "cumulative":{"vision_tokens":145,"text_input_tokens":78,"text_output_tokens":10,"text_tokens":88,"total_tokens":233}
  }
}
```

A model-silence boundary uses `boundary=silence`, `finish_reason=stop`. If the backend naturally finishes with an active segment, it uses `boundary=request_end` and the model finish reason (`stop` for normal stopping, `length` for exhausted allowance), followed by session.done. Already settled segments are not settled again. Abort/failure does not fabricate a normal response completion.

### 4.9 `session.usage`

Optional runtime telemetry, at most 1 Hz when `include_usage=true`. It is neither a periodic heartbeat nor a guarantee that the final snapshot will be sent. It is not the accounting source.

```json
{"type":"session.usage","encoder_tokens":3536,"decoder_tokens":329,"encoder_kv_tokens":1547,"token_space_used":3865,"context_limit":131072,"context_remaining":127207}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `encoder_tokens` | Historical visual positions |
| `decoder_tokens` | Backend's currently observed text positions |
| `encoder_kv_tokens` | Resident visual KV positions; may decrease with sliding-window eviction |
| `token_space_used` | Historical context-position usage, not resident GPU memory or total resident KV |
| `context_limit` | Effective configured context capacity |
| `context_remaining` | `max(0, context_limit - token_space_used)` |

Telemetry may lag settlement watermarks and MUST NOT replace accurate response/session done usage. Remaining capacity does not guarantee admission of an arbitrarily sized next input.

### 4.10 `session.done`

```json
{"type":"session.done","session_id":"video_sess_...","request_id":"video_req_...","reason":"completed","aborted":false,"usage":{"vision_tokens":145,"text_input_tokens":78,"text_output_tokens":10,"text_tokens":88,"total_tokens":233}}
```

usage is the cumulative final session total on the same basis as response.done.usage.cumulative, including consumption after the last response.done.

| reason | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `completed` | Backend ended under its normal stop/length conditions, usually after final input |
| `aborted` | Client requested termination |
| `context_exhausted` | Context capacity exhausted |
| `error` | Timeout or backend failure, preceded by error |

aborted is true only when reason is aborted. Capacity rejection precedes session creation and uses the reduced terminal format in section 7.4.

### 4.11 `error`

```json
{"type":"error","code":"invalid_request","seq_no":12,"message":"expected seq_no 1, received 12"}
```

code and message are required. An input-triggered error includes seq_no when an integer sequence number is identifiable. Connection-level errors, configuration errors and missing/unparseable sequence numbers omit it. Clients MUST NOT drive behavior by matching message strings.

### 4.12 Identifiers and Turns

- Backend-assigned turn_id starts at zero and advances when a new question is processed, including a frame carrying a nonempty question. Frames alone, silence and same-turn speech continuation do not advance it. Accepted does not mean the model has already advanced the turn.
- One turn may contain multiple responses. turn_id MUST NOT be used as the unique response.done key, and not every turn necessarily has a done event.
- response_id is created on each segment's first visible text. Associate text, interruption and settlement using session identity plus response_id.
- response_seq starts at 1 and increases within the session. Interrupted segments consume a number, so consecutive done events may skip numbers. It is distinct from contiguous accepted input seq_no.
- New connections have new session, request and response identities. Cross-session deduplication, memory and usage aggregation belong to the caller.

## 5. Usage and Accounting

### 5.1 Token Definitions

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `vision_tokens` | Committed logical visual encoder positions, including visual separators; based on actual input, not a fixed 145 per frame |
| `text_input_tokens` | Committed initial user/system prompts, questions, frame-associated text and actual template positions |
| `text_output_tokens` | Confirmed generated tokens, including text, silence, EOS and control tokens |
| `text_tokens` | text_input_tokens + text_output_tokens |
| `total_tokens` | vision_tokens + text_tokens |

Accounting uses actual logical model positions, not tokenizing user strings alone, image bytes, FLOPs or resident memory. A generated token reused as input on the next step is not billed again as text input. Failed, uncommitted input and discarded lookahead steps are excluded. TP ranks do not multiply usage.

### 5.2 Response Increment

**Increment = current cumulative - previous response.done cumulative; the first response.done subtracts zero.** This applies independently to all five usage fields.

- Initial configuration and template overhead belong to the first response.done.
- Frames between answers, silent tokens and interrupted segments carry into the next increment.
- Tokens are not assigned to multiple increments; consumption after the last answer is covered by the final residual.

Both increment and cumulative are supplied. **The sum of all response.done increments equals the last response.done cumulative.** Consumers can check this identity; a mismatch warrants investigating missing or duplicate events.

### 5.3 Cumulative Usage and Residual

cumulative and session.done.usage use historical totals: committed positions remain counted after visual KV eviction.

```text
Final residual = session.done.usage - sum of received response.done increments
```

Do not add the full session.done total to the response increments; that double counts. With no response.done, the final total covers all consumption. Reset/rollover implemented through a new connection starts a separate ledger and does not inherit the previous one automatically.

Example numbers illustrate fields and arithmetic, not fixed per-frame costs or billing bounds.

## 6. Limits and Capacity

| Item | Current Default / Source |
| --- | --- |
| Configure deadline | 180 seconds; use session.created |
| Frame byte limit | Current backend: 32 MiB; use session.configured.max_frame_bytes. Deployment ingress may impose another limit |
| input_queue_capacity | Default 4; reserved inputs not yet processed per session, including a frame awaiting binary |
| Binary deadline | Default 10 seconds after ready; image validation has a separate default 10-second processing deadline |
| Parked timeout | Low-level default 300 seconds, repository launch setting 3600 seconds; use session.configured |
| context_limit | Actual backend configuration; repository launch setting 131072 |
| Session capacity | Repository launch setting 4, shared by v1/v2, not four each |
| Visual window | Repository launcher keeps 60 seconds of raw visual KV; this does not guarantee historical context-position reclamation |

input_queue_capacity is neither the number of simultaneous frame handshakes nor an inference batch size. When credit is exhausted, new input waits for credit. Clients MUST continue reading events and obey ready/accepted backpressure rather than accumulating messages.

The parked timeout applies to a model request in silence waiting for fresh input, not total session duration or WebSocket heartbeat. Visual-window eviction is not text-memory compression. This API does not create memory/ASR/TTS services or perform application rollover.

Visual positions depend on image resolution and actual preprocessing. Do not derive universal video-duration limits using a fixed 145 tokens/frame; plan input using actual observations and capacity.

## 7. Termination and Errors

### 7.1 Error Codes

| code | Meaning | Session Continues? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `invalid_request` | Invalid client event, sequence or recoverable image validation failure | Yes |
| `context_exhausted` | Context exhausted; further input cannot be admitted | No |
| `session_timeout` | Configure, binary reception/validation or parked-idle timeout | No |
| `response_failed` | Backend failure, input queue overflow or final-accounting failure | No |
| `session_capacity_exceeded` | No session slot at connection admission | No model session created |

Clients MUST treat unknown codes as terminal to support future additions without synchronized releases.

### 7.2 Terminal Guarantee and Exceptions

On normal completion or orderly abort, the backend freezes committed usage before sending one session.done and closing normally. Fatal errors follow error -> session.done -> close; session_timeout maps to reason=error. Submission of an abort request is not assumed to mean GPU work and accounting have finished.

Final-accounting acknowledgement waits up to 20 seconds by default; network sends and cleanup have additional bounded waits. Twenty seconds is not a total shutdown SLA. Clients should stop sending input immediately but continue receiving the terminal event.

**Exception:** if trustworthy final accounting is unavailable, including an internal management-channel timeout, the adapter sends a best-effort response_failed and closes with WebSocket 1011. It does not send session.done with invented zero or incomplete final usage. Disconnection/process failure also cannot guarantee terminal delivery. Clients MUST handle abnormal closure without session.done and mark final usage unknown, not zero or fully settled.

### 7.3 Recoverable Rejection

Invalid client events receive error while the connection stays open. An identifiable sequence number is included. Rejected frames additionally receive input.frame.rejected to end the handshake wait.

Rejecting another metadata message does not clear a different valid pending frame. Recoverably rejected binary releases that frame's credit; retry by sending metadata with the same sequence number. Duplicate binary and excessive queued input can instead cause fatal termination under section 7.1.

### 7.4 Admission Failure

When capacity is exhausted, the server accepts the WebSocket, sends the following events and closes with 1013. There is no session.created, no model consumption and no allocated session identifiers:

```json
{"type":"error","code":"session_capacity_exceeded","message":"video realtime service has no free session slot (capacity 4)"}
```

```json
{"type":"session.done","reason":"error","usage":{"vision_tokens":0,"text_input_tokens":0,"text_output_tokens":0,"text_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0}}
```

Authentication failure rejects before WebSocket acceptance, normally as handshake HTTP 403. WebSocket error/session.done delivery is not guaranteed in that case.

## 8. Complete Sequence and Client Rules

```text
client                                      server
  |-------- WebSocket Upgrade -------------->|
  |<------- session.created -----------------| capabilities / limits
  |-------- session.configure -------------->|
  |<------- session.configured --------------| context_limit
  |<------- session.ready -------------------|
  |-------- input.frame (seq 0) ------------>|
  |<------- input.frame.ready ---------------|
  |-------- binary image ------------------->|
  |<------- input.frame.accepted ------------|
  |<------- input.frame.processed -----------|
  |<------- response.turn.silence -----------| no text: no done
  |-------- input.prompt (seq 1) ----------->|
  |<------- input.prompt.accepted -----------|
  |<------- interrupted / processed ---------| turn advances
  |<------- response.text.delta x N ---------| response A
  |<------- response.turn.silence -----------|
  |<------- response.done -------------------| settle A; stay connected
  |-------- input.frame (seq 2) ... -------->|
  |<------- response.text.delta x N ---------| response B, same turn
  |<------- response.turn.silence -----------|
  |<------- response.done -------------------| settle B
  |-------- input.prompt (seq 3, final) ---->|
  |<------- accepted / processed / output ---|
  |<------- response.done -------------------| only if a segment completes
  |<------- session.done --------------------| frozen total, residual included
  |<------- WebSocket Close 1000 ------------|
```

Responses depend on the model; an input may produce only silence. Telemetry is omitted from the diagram. Keep reading all events, associate responses by response_id, stay connected after response.done, reconcile increments and final residuals, and end pending handshake waits on terminal events or abnormal disconnects. Native v1/Demo clients MUST NOT switch to this endpoint without adapting their done handling.
