"""Two-level sliding window over the vision (cross-attention) KV region.

Layer one (raw window, ``raw_window_s``): frames whose timestamp trails the
newest raw frame by more than ``raw_window_s`` leave the raw region of the
request's page-table row.

Layer two (compressed window, ``pool_window_s`` + ``pool_ratio``): aged-out raw
frames are not dropped outright — full chunks of exactly ``pool_ratio``
consecutive frames with identical spatial grids fold into one *virtual frame*
whose K/V is the per-position mean of the members across every KV layer (T
axis ratio→1, H×W unchanged). Aged remainders below one full chunk stay raw
until the group fills (streaming at 1fps would otherwise emit 1:1 virtual
frames and never realize the compression). The virtual frame's slots are
freshly allocated and inserted at the end of the compressed region (the
page-row prefix ahead of the raw frames).
Virtual frames trailing the newest virtual frame by more than ``pool_window_s``
are freed for good — the frame pixels long ago entered the embedding store, so
dropping the KV is "rolling the frame into memory".
Layer two is **off by default** (``pooling_enabled=False``): the mean-pooled
virtual K/V is never seen in training, and the A/B experiment on the 420s
jumping-jack case showed no quality gain over the raw-only window while
doubling steady-state vision KV. Enable it explicitly via config field
``realtime_frame_pooling_enabled`` or env ``REALTIME_FRAME_POOLING_ENABLED=1``.

Everything here is inert unless ``RealtimeFrameWindowConfig.enabled`` is set
(config field ``realtime_frame_window_enabled`` or env
``REALTIME_FRAME_WINDOW_ENABLED=1``). With the feature off none of these
functions run and serving behavior is unchanged.

Correctness anchors:
- The row layout is [compressed virtuals]{oldest→newest} ++ [raw frames] ++
  [decoder text]; ``full_grid_thw`` rows and visible-frame counts stay aligned
  with that exact frame order, so the delta-mask builder
  (``sglang_model.use_realtime_full_grid_thw``) needs no changes.
- Vision K was rotated with absolute MRoPE positions at write time, so evicting
  a prefix needs no position rewrite on the survivors.
- Compaction deliberately does **not** go through the KV-append transaction:
  ``apply_frame_window_plan`` validates everything that can fail (record/span
  coverage, visible-count remap) and builds every derived tensor *before* the
  page-row rewrite, so nothing past the ``allocator.free`` call can raise. A
  pre-rewrite failure frees only the freshly allocated pooled slots and leaves
  the committed layout untouched.
- Pooled-virtual visibility is deliberately relaxed: a text token that saw at
  least one member frame of a chunk is remapped to see the whole pooled frame,
  including members that had not arrived when the token was generated. Combined
  with the mean-pooled K representation (not a legal RoPE K at any single
  position), this is a training-side-unseen distribution — which is why the
  feature stays opt-in.
- The window reclaims KV memory only. Token space keeps one pad placeholder per
  historical encoder slot in ``full_untruncated_fill_ids``, so the context
  budget (``_guard_realtime_context_capacity`` bills ``max(token, KV)``) still
  bounds session lifetime; the window does not extend it.
