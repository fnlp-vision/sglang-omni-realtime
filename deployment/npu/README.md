# Ascend Integration

**English** | [简体中文](./README_zh.md)

Native MOSS-VL serving on Ascend, with the shared [legacy VL adapter](../../vl_legacy_adapter/README.md). The native backend serves `/v1/video/realtime`; the separate adapter serves `/v1/realtime`. There is no second legacy protocol implementation inside the backend.

## Environment

Target stack: Ascend 910B2C, CANN 9.0.0, PyTorch/torch_npu 2.11, SGLang 0.5.14 or 0.5.16 with Ascend support, Transformers 5.12.1, and Python 3.12 or 3.13. Use the NPU maintainer's matching environment and a local [MOSS-VL-Realtime-SGLANG](https://huggingface.co/OpenMOSS-Team/MOSS-VL-Realtime-SGLANG) checkpoint. Do not apply the CUDA dependency lock to this environment. Both SGLang versions are implementation targets and require separate runtime acceptance; vendor builds must provide the corresponding upstream APIs.

| SGLang API | Integration behavior |
| --- | --- |
| 0.5.16: `ModelRunner(ps=...)`, native `NextBatchPlan` and request range | Native APIs, no legacy runtime patches |
| 0.5.14: flat rank arguments, scheduler-owned batches, `fill_len`/`extend_input_len` | Instance-local scheduler bridge, synchronized request range, explicit forward overrides and KV profiling adapter |

Compatibility follows inspected API signatures rather than only a version string. Unknown constructors or unsupported forward arguments fail explicitly. The bridge does not replace methods on the upstream Scheduler class, disable memory allocation, or discard forward overrides. Source references: [0.5.14 scheduler](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/v0.5.14/python/sglang/srt/managers/scheduler.py), [0.5.14 ModelRunner](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/v0.5.14/python/sglang/srt/model_executor/model_runner.py).

Run from the repository root using that environment's Python:

```bash
python -m pip install --no-deps -e .
bash patches/npu/apply_npu_patches.sh
export ASCEND_USE_FA=false
export ASCEND_USE_FIA=false
```

The patch installer operates on the active interpreter's SGLang package; an optional argument selects its `site-packages` directory. It selects the 0.5.14 or 0.5.16 patch set from the installed ModelRunner signature. `--patch-set 0.5.14` or `--patch-set 0.5.16` selects a source layout explicitly for vendor backports; incompatible sources still fail. Stop serving processes before patching. All patches are staged before installation; already-applied patches are accepted, incompatible sources fail rather than being skipped, and modified files get `.moss-npu.bak` backups. Restart after installation. The environment must already contain application dependencies, including FastAPI, websockets, Pillow, psutil, pytest and pytest-asyncio.

Frame visibility uses per-request masks in the native extend path. Cross-attention uses explicit Torch operations rather than fused SDPA; self-attention dispatch is unchanged. Both version-specific patch sets include the common `0004-use-torch-cross-attention.patch`. Rerun the installer when upgrading an already-patched environment. FA/FIA, speculative and context-parallel paths are not accepted for masked cross-attention. Missing visibility or Torch-path support prevents startup. Decode retains its existing all-visible encoder behavior.

## Start

```bash
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/model bash deploy.sh start
# Two TP2 groups, logical devices 0,1 and 2,3:
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/model bash deploy.sh start4
# Two TP4 groups, logical devices 0-3 and 4-7:
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/model bash deploy.sh start8
```

Each command runs in the foreground. Stop with Ctrl-C or SIGTERM from a service manager; cleanup is restricted to owned processes. The former process-name-based `stop`/`restart` commands are not used. Logs are kept in a printed, unique `/tmp/moss-npu-*` directory. Any child failure stops the supervised deployment.

| Setting | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Native backend ports | `PORT=8000`, then 8001 for the second group |
| Legacy adapter ports | `ADAPTER_PORT=18600`, then 18601 |
| Single group device | `GPU=0`, or `GPUS=0,1` for TP |
| Group override | `NPU_GROUPS='0,1;2,3'` |
| Backend session capacity | Device count in each group; override `MAX_RUNNING_REQUESTS` |
| Adapter capacity | `MAX_INFLIGHT=1`; set independently for concurrent callers |
| Context / memory fraction | TP2: 8192 / 0.80; otherwise 32768 / 0.70 |

NPU serving defaults are centralized in [config.py](./config.py) and used by the supervisor. `CONTEXT_LENGTH`, `MEM_FRACTION` and `HOST` override the defaults; CUDA configuration is unaffected. Device IDs are logical indices in the visible-device list. Verify HCCS planes on the actual host; the example grouping is not a portable hardware topology guarantee. Each adapter connects to its own backend, not to a load balancer. Capacity and memory defaults need NPU acceptance testing.

NPU startup locks resolve local IDs through `ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES` and use an NPU-specific lock namespace. CUDA retains its existing lock mapping. TP communication initialization receives the deployment-assigned rendezvous port through the standard model-runner path.

For the opt-in [VL API v2](../../vl_api_adapter/README.md), add `--vl-api-v2-port 18610` to `examples/run_moss_vl_realtime_server.py` in the prepared NPU environment. `deploy.sh` continues to start native v1 and the legacy adapter only. The `vl_api_adapter/start.sh` wrapper uses the CUDA deployment profile and is not the NPU launcher.

## Acceptance

**Status: main integration candidate; CPU regressions pass, hardware acceptance pending.** This branch combines main `194bcc8` with Ascend integration `790b96e`, including history prefill and VL API v2. See [validation results](./VALIDATION.md). Historical CUDA measurements elsewhere are not hardware acceptance results for this candidate.

Attention tests normally read the installed SGLang sources. Set `NPU_TEST_SITE_PACKAGES` to test a patched private copy without modifying the serving environment.

`perf.sh` defaults to five rounds of four distinct repository frames at 160 tokens/s, with a real 10 s deadline per round. It requires all ACKs and visible text, preserves output interleaved with ACKs, and measures TTFT from connection start to the first visible text. `FRAMES_DIR`, `NFRAMES`, `ROUNDS`, `TOKEN_RATE`, `TIMEOUT_S` and `VL_MODEL_WS_URL` configure it. These are protocol/latency checks, not HF equivalence proofs.

Run the checks independently in both SGLang environments. Required before main: NPU HF/SGLang comparison for multi-frame extend, questions before/after frame boundaries, retained visual KV, visual-window transitions, no-visible-frame rows and mixed-length 1/2/4 sessions. Use matching inputs and sampling in the maintainer's HF harness; retain output and first-divergence evidence. Also cover delayed/missing binaries, malformed images, setup failure, cancellation/reconnect and memory reclamation, plus CUDA regressions. The existing CUDA accuracy launcher is not an NPU evaluation script.
